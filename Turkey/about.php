		We breed, raise, and slaughter all of our own turkeys here. All of our turkeys are fed a well-balanced grain diet. We do use a preventative feed while they are baby turkeys, however, it does not contain antibiotics. This gives our birds a healthy start before they transition to natural nutrients. Our birds are grown in barns and outdoor pens, free to move around as they wish.
